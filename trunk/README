A small and simple implementation of a DBGP proxy daemon.
The idea was to do a proof of concept implementation in PHP and use it as a base
for a C implementation, that's why the code looks like last Thursday. (And
because much of it was written of the top of the head w/o planning. *sigh*)

The code include style might also look a bit off, that's because it was planned
to be used with bcompiler.

USAGE

php dbgpproxy.php

If your PHP spits out something about missing pcntl_fork, change
$options['deamonize'] to false in src/main.php. It will not daemonize and you'll
be stuck using screen or similar.

-----
What I want to fix:
- have a true nonblocking application. This means that I need to move all buffer
  handling  to the network code. Yay...
- clean it up? We know we aint gonna port it to C now.
